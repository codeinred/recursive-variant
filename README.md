# `rva::variant`: Recursive Sum Types for C++

_Provided by the Recursive Variant Authority. We stand united in opposition to
the [TVA](https://youtu.be/nW948Va-l10). May your variants never be pruned._

Variants are exceedingly useful in C++, but they suffer from a singular and
fundamental shortcoming: unlike sum types in many other languages, there's no
mechanism to define recursive variants in C++.

The Recursive Variant Authority provides a solution in the form of
`rva::variant`, which allows you to write arbitrary recursive sum types with
functionality identical to that provided by `std::variant`.

## Understanding Recursive Variants

To understand what a recursive variant is, and why it's useful, consider
something like a value in json. It can be any of the following:

- A null value
- A string
- A number (usually represented as a double)
- A boolean value (either true or false),
- An object (aka, a map between strings and json values)
- An array of values.

In a language like haskell, we could copy that definition pretty much verbatim
(accounting for syntax, of course):

```hs
data JsonValue = JsonNull
               | JsonBoolean Bool
               | JsonNumber Double
               | JsonStr String
               | JsonObject (Map String JsonValue)
               | JsonArray [JsonValue]
```

It's important to note that `JsonValue` is being used in it's own definition:
it's a recursive type.

## Recursive types in C++

While this may seem a bit strange at first, recursive types aren't all that
unusual. C++ has them too, and it's common for a type to store pointers to
itself in situations such as a binary tree or a linked list. We can even define
`json_value` as a recursive type using a union:

```cpp
class json_value {
    int state = -1;
    union {
        /* state 0 */ std::nullptr_t m_null;
        /* state 1 */ bool m_bool;
        /* state 2 */ double m_number;
        /* state 3 */ std::string m_string;
        /* state 4 */ std::map<std::string, json_value> m_object;
        /* state 5 */ std::vector<json_value> m_array;
    };

   public:
    json_value(std::nullptr_t) : state(0), m_null() {}
    json_value(bool b) : state(1), m_bool(b) {}
    json_value(double d) : state(2), m_number(d) {}
    json_value(std::string const& str) : state(3), m_string(str) {}
    json_value(std::map<std::string, json_value> const& map) : state(4), m_object(map) {}
    json_value(std::vector<json_value> const& arr) : state(5), m_object(m_array) {}

    // Now we need to write move constructors...
    json_value(std::string&& str) : state(3), m_string(std::move(str)) {}
    json_value(std::map<std::string, json_value>&& map) : state(4), m_object(std::move(map)) {}
    json_value(std::vector<json_value>&& arr) : state(5), m_object(std::move(m_array)) {}

    // Now assignment operators...

    // Now comparison operators...

    // .emplace() might be nice

    // Oh hey did we forget copy and move assignment for json_value?

    // maybe we should have a way to check what the index of the currently active element is
};
```

## `std::variant` is only a partial solution

It quickly becomes apparent that the class we're writing is essentially a
specialization of `std::variant`, which (thankfully) simplifies a lot of the
code:

```cpp
class json_value {
    std::variant<
        std::nullptr_t,
        bool,
        double,
        std::string,
        std::map<std::string, json_value>,
        std::vector<json_value>> value;

   public:
    json_value() = default;
    json_value(json_value const&) = default;
    json_value(json_value&&) = default;
    template <class T>
    json_value(T&& object) : value(std::forward<T>(object)) {}


    // Now assignment operators...

    // Now comparison operators...

    // .emplace() might be nice

    // maybe we should have a way to check what the index of the currently active element is
};
```

This is better, and signifigantly less bug prone, but there's still a lot of
boilerplate code that needs to be written.

Here's the thing: at it's core, some types (like json_value) are best expressed
as sum types! Anything we write to wrap one will just be a specialization of a
sum type, and will usually involve a lot of boilerplate code to do the wrapping.

At this point, it might be prudent to ask: can we define `json_value` directly
as a `std::variant`? Would a recursive `using` declaration work? I wish it did.
I really, really wish it did.

```cpp
// LIES!!! This code doesn't work
// error: use of undeclared identifier 'json_value'
using json_value = std::variant<
    std::nullptr_t,                          // json null
    bool,                                    // json boolean
    double,                                  // json number
    std::string,                             // json string
    std::map<std::string, json_value>,       // json object
    std::vector<json_value>>;                // json array
```

## The Recursive Variant Authority provides a complete solution!

`rva::variant` allows you to write recursive variants _without any boilerplate_
by passing `rva::self_t` in the places where you want your recursive type to go!
When you write a statement like this, `rva::variant` will replace instances of
`rva::self_t` with a properly specified instance of it's type, and it does this
as a paper-thin wrapper over `std::variant` that provides all your boilerplate
code for you. And there was a _lot_ of boilerplate code to write.

```cpp
using json_value = rva::variant<
    std::nullptr_t,                       // json null
    bool,                                 // json boolean
    double,                               // json number
    std::string,                          // json string
    std::map<std::string, rva::self_t>,   // json object, type is std::map<std::string, json_value>
    std::vector<rva::self_t>>;            // json array, type is std::vector<json_value>
```

`rva::variant` provides the full set of functionality given by `std::variant`,
including:

- `visit`,
- `get`,
- `get_if`,
- `holds_alternative`,
- `std::variant_size`,
- `std::variant_alternative`,
- `std::hash`)

And it does so as a drop-in replacement (or as close to one as the standard
would allow)!

The Recursive Variant Authority hopes that you enjoy your time using
`rva::variant`, and we encourage you to make full use of it's capabilities when
writing your code.
